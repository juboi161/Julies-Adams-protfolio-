# Julies-Adams-protfolio-
I am a dedicated data analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights. Having transitioned from a career in education, where I focused on teaching and mentoring black and brown boys, I bring a unique perspective to data analysisâ€”balancing technical skills with a strong commitment to education and social impact.

With expertise in tools such as Excel, Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, I aim to leverage data to solve complex business problems and improve decision-making processes. I am particularly interested in the intersection of data analytics and education, and I hope to use data-driven insights to influence positive changes in global educational systems.
